Title: "Array index out of bounds error in Free Pascal 3.2.2"

I'm getting an array index error in Free Pascal 3.2.2 on Windows 10.

Code:
var arr: array[1..5] of integer;
begin
  arr[6] := 10; // This causes the error
end.

Error: "Range check error while trying to access array element"

I understand the error, but how can I prevent this at runtime?
```
